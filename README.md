# Wordle-Clone

Wordle is a popular word-guessing game played online, where players have six chances to guess a five-letter word chosen by the game. The game starts by displaying a row of blank boxes that represent the five-letter word. The player then enters a word guess, and the game responds by highlighting the letters in the word that are correct and in the right position with green boxes, and the letters that are correct but in the wrong position with yellow boxes. If a letter is not in the word, it is indicated with a gray box. The player uses this feedback to make educated guesses until they correctly guess the word within the allotted six tries. The game is played without time constraints, and the goal is to correctly guess the word using as few guesses as possible.
